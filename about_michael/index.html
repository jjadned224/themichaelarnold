                Michael is a problem finder, solver and occasional causer.  He has spent over 25 years in quality in the automotive industry.  During this time he earned his Shainin Red X Journeyman and Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt.  He has managed and developed multiple Advanced Problem Solving teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                Several years ago, a coach encouraged Michael to get uncomfortable and start seriously pursuing his dreams.  Very soon after, he auditioned for a TEDx open mic night.  This led to his first TEDx in 2018 on teaching kids better problem-solving skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During this speech, he reflected on how he really wanted to be an astronaut as a child.  In high school, as he started seriously looking at careers, he realized that he was three inches too tall to be an astronaut.  He decided then to become an engineer.  This gave him the idea to solve the problem by "building a taller spaceship."  This became his motto as he looks to help others solve the problems holding them back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, Michael has given a second TEDx on The Cure for Lazy Leadership.  He earned his Distinguished Toastmasters, their highest honor.  Michael is a certified Maxwell Leadership Team coach, trainer, and speaker.  He speaks on leadership, the power of successful storytelling, and how to connect with people.
            </p>
            <p>    
                He lives in Anderson, South Carolina with his wife, also a mechanical engineer. He has two sons: one an electrical engineer and the other, an aspiring computer engineer. Yes, they are an exciting family of nerds!  </p>
